The application gets rendered in index.html in the div id = root

All dependencies are stored in package.json

node_modules/ dir is where all of the dependencies get built/stored (shouldnâ€™t have to mess with it)

Src/ is important directory. Stores all modifiable code. 

index.js stores main Render call from ReactDOM. Imports App.js component that we start off with and tells React where to render it.

Render() takes two arguments:
1. Which component to render
2. Where to render it

Redux: control state
One-dimensional: passing state down to react components

Lay out components: search component, video list item, selected video

Use react router to make it look like we're going to different pages. 

RegisterServiceWorker means react can mostly run when you're offline.

Style components: create variable object to define styles, apply to divs in component

Explore testing in React -- use test.app

Rule of thumb Make your components dumb (constant, doesn't have state) until otherwise

Use export default if there's only one thing or if there's nothing named in file. 

Components, at the end of the day, are functions; props are just arguments into a function

Make a dumb component smart: write the smart stuff beneath dumb stuff, confirm, then delete dumb one
